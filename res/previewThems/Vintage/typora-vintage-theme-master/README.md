# Vintage Theme for Typora
`Vintage` is a typora theme and featured with following aspects:

- A simple and powerful three-line `table` and a beautiful, easy-to-read `task list`.
- A concise interface with appropriate distances between objects.
- A variety of different headings with totally 6 levels: H3 is marked in brown to distinguish it from other headers. Every `header`/`ToC item`/`outline item` is automatically enquiped with a section number to indicate the position.
- Dark mode.
